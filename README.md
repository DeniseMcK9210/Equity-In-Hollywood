# Project 2 - Equity-In-Hollywood

## Background

Welcome to Hollywood! You are a new movie producer with a hobby in data science and analytics that is passionate about the representation of women in fiction. 
After studying the Bechdel Test in a womens studies class and learning that only half of all movies pass the Bechdel test you decided to take a 
further look before choosing what type of film to produce as your first Hollywood picture! Using data from 4 CSV files you found online and an IMDB
API key you will create a study that focuses on the following questions:

	1.	Have more films passed the Bechdel test over time?
	2.	Which genre dominates or under performs in passing the Bechdel test?
	3.	Is the American public interested in diverse Hollywood titles?
	4.	Are Hollywood film makers investing in movies that pass the Bechdel test?

Since data science and analytics is also a hobby of yours you decdie to post your findings to a web page for other inspiring Hollywood producers to see!

## Before you Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `Equity-In-Hollywood`. **Do not add this project to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for this project. Use folders to keep organized!

4. This project utilizes both **html** and **Javascript** so be sure to add all the necessary files. These will be the main files to run for analysis.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Your Task

Your task is to tell a story through data visualizations. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, Javascript,
and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). Your final project should:
1. Be a combination of web scraping and Plotly. 
2. Include at least one new JS library that you have note learned yet
3. Powered by a dataset with at least 100 records
4. Include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes)
5. at least three views in your final visualization

### Assessment 
Your final product will be assesed on the following metrics:
1. Theme Description: Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project, the questions your group found interesting, and what motivated you
   to answer them.
2. Summarize the data: Where/how you found it and the munging techniques/process
3. View 1 Quality 
4. View 2 Quality 
5. View 3 Quality 
6. User-driven interaction (menus, dropdowns, textboxes)
7. Tell a good story: storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative, use your analysis/vizualization 
   skills and highlight conflict/resolution in your data.
8. Use of Flask, html, css, javascript, database
9. Use of a new javascript library
